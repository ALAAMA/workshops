* Workshop overview and materials

** Workshop description
This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with basic knowledge of R. It is intended for those already comfortable with using R for data analysis who wish to move on to writing their own functions. To the extent possible this workshop uses real-world examples. That is to say that concepts are introduced as they are needed for a realistic analysis task. In the course of working through a realistic project we will lean about interacting with web services, regular expressions, iteration, functions, control flow and more. 

 Prerequisite: basic familiarity with R, such as acquired from an introductory R workshop.


** Materials and setup

Everyone should have R installed -- if not:

- Open a web browser and go to [[http://cran.r-project.org]] and download and install it
- Also helpful to install RStudio (download from [[http://rstudio.com]])

Materials for this workshop include slides, example data sets, and example code.

- Download materials from [[http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/RProgramming.zip]]
- Extract the zip file containing the materials to your desktop

** Launch RStudio on Athena					   :mitsetup:

- To start R *type these commands in the terminal*:
:     add r
:     rstudio
- Open up today's R script

  - In RStudio, Go to *File => Open Script*

  - Locate and open the =RProgramming.R= script in the Rintro folder in your home directory

- Go to *Tools => Set working directory => To source file location* (more on the working directory later)

- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!

** Example project overview
Throughout this workshop we will return to a running example that involves acquiring, processing, and analyzing data from the [[http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data/][Displaced Worker Survery]] (DWS). In this context we will learn about finding and using R packages, importing and manipulating data, writing functions, and more. The web page has been mirrored at [[http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data]] for convenience.

* Extracting elements from html
It is common for data to be made available on a website somewhere, either by a government agency, research group, or other organizations and entities. Often the data you want is spread over many files, and retrieving it all one file at a time is tedious and time consuming. Such is the case with the CPS data we will be using today.

The Center for Economic and Policy Research has helpfully [[http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data/][compiled DWS data going back to 1994]][fn:1]. Although we could open a web browser and download these files one at a time, it will be faster and easier to instruct R to do that for us. Doing it this way will also give us an excuse to talk about html parsing, regular expressions, package management, and other useful techniques.

Our goal is to download all the Stata data sets from [[http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data/]]. In order to do that we need a list of the Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of those files. The URLs we need are right there as links in the ceprdata.org webpage. All we have to do is read that data in a way R can understand. 

** Packages for parsing html
In order extract the data URls from the ceprdata.org website we need a package for parsing XML and HTML. How do we find such a package?
- Task views :: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html
- R package search :: http://www.r-pkg.org/search.html?q=html+xml
- Web search :: https://www.google.com/search?q=R+parse+html+xml&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8

For parsing html in R I recommend either the =xml2= package or the =rvest= package, with the former being more flexible and the later being more user friendly. Let's use the friendlier one.

** Extracting information from web pages with the =rvest= package

Our first task is to read the web page into R. We can do that using the =read_html= function. Next we want to find all the links (the =<a>= tags) and extract their =href= attributes. To give a better sense of this here is what the html for the 2010 data file link looks like:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <a onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'File','Download', 'cepr_dws_2010_dta']);"
     href="/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2010_dta.zip">cepr_dws_2010_dta.zip</a>
#+END_EXAMPLE
We want the =href= part, i.e., "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2010_dta.zip".

We can get all the =<a>= elements using the =html_nodes= function, and then extract the =href= attributes usig the =html_attr= function, like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## install.packages("rvest")
  library(rvest)
  
  ## read the web page into R
  dataPage <- read_html("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data/")

  ## find the link ("a") elements.
  allAnchors <- html_nodes(dataPage, "a")
  head(allAnchors, 15)

  ## extract the link ("href") attributes
  allLinks <- html_attr(allAnchors, "href")
  head(allLinks, 15)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> ## install.packages("rvest")
> library(rvest)
> 
> ## read the web page into R
> dataPage <- read_html("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-data/")
> 
> ## find the link ("a") elements.
> allAnchors <- html_nodes(dataPage, "a")
> head(allAnchors, 15)

** Just the data please -- regular expressions to the rescue
Looking at the output from the previous example you might notice a problem; we've matched _all_ the URLs on the web page. Some of those (the ones that end in .zip) are the ones we want, others are menu links that we don't want. How can we separate the data links from the other links on the page?

One answer is to use regular expressions to idenfify the links we want. Regular expressions are useful in general (not just in R!) and it is a good idea to be familiar with at least the basics. For our present purpose it will be more than enough to use regular expression that matches strings starting with =/wp= and ending with =.zip=.

In regulars expression =^=, =.=, =*=, and =$= are special characters with the following meanings:
- ^ :: matches the beginning of the string
- . :: matches any character
- * :: repeates the last caracter zero or more times
- $ :: matches the end of the string

If you have not been introduced to regular expressions yet a nice interactive regex tester is available at [[http://www.regexr.com/]] and an interactive tutorial is available at [[http://www.regexone.com/]].

R comes with a =grep= function that can be used to search for patterns in strings, but for more sophisticated string manipulation I recommend the =stringi= package. The function names are more verbose, but it provides much more complete and robust string handling than is available in base R. For our relatively simple needs =grep= will suffice, but if you need to do extensive string manipulation in R the =stringi= package is the way to go.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  dataLinks <- grep("^/wp.*\\.zip$", allLinks, value = TRUE)
  head(dataLinks)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> dataLinks <- grep("^/wp.*\\.zip$", allLinks, value = TRUE)
> head(dataLinks)
[1] "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2010_dta.zip"
[2] "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2008_dta.zip"
[3] "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2006_dta.zip"

[5] "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2002_dta.zip"
[6] "/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_2000_dta.zip"
> 
#+end_example

(Note that the backslashes in the above example are used to escape the =.= so that it is matched literally instead of matching any characters as it normallly would in a regular expression.)

Finally, the data links we've extracted are relative to the ceprdata website. To make them valid we need to prepend =http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/= to each one. We can do that using the =paste= function.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  dataLinks <- paste("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu", dataLinks, sep = "")
  head(dataLinks)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> dataLinks <- paste("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu", dataLinks, sep = "")
> head(dataLinks)

** Getting the list of data links the easy way
If you look at the result from the previous two methods you might notice that the URLs are all the same save for the year number. This suggests an even easier way to construct the list of URLs:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  (dataLinks <- paste("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_",
                      seq(1994, 2010, by = 2),
                      "_dta.zip",
                      sep = ""))

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> (dataLinks <- paste("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/wp-content/cps/data/cepr_dws_",
+                     seq(1994, 2010, by = 2),
+                     "_dta.zip",
+                     sep = ""))

Wow, that was a _lot_ easier. Why oh why didn't we just do that in the first place? Well, it works for this specific case, but it is much less general than the html parsing methods we discussed previously. Those methods will work in the general case, while pasting the year number into the URLs only works because the URLs we want have a very regular and consistent form.


* Exercise 0: html parsing
The [[http://ceprdata.org/]] website provides code books for the DWS data in =.pdf= format. Links to these code books are available on the documentation page at [[http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-documentation/]]. Parse this page and extract the links to the code books.

* Exercise 0 prototype                                            :prototype:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## read in the html page
  ceprDoc <- read_html(
    "http://ceprdata.org/cps-uniform-data-extracts/cps-displaced-worker-survey/cps-dws-documentation/"
  )
  ## get the codebook links
  ceprCodeBookLinks <- html_attr(#extract attributes
    html_nodes(#from nodes  
      ceprDoc,#in ceprDoc
      ## This uses an xpath expression to select just the codebook links.
      ## You could alternatively download all the links and filter them
      ## with a regular expression. Use whatever works and is comfortable!
      ## There is more than one right way.
      xpath = '//*[@id="content"]/article/div/ul[1]//a'),#matching this xpath
    'href' #extract href attributes
  )
#+END_SRC

* Downloading files in R
Now that we have a vector of URLs pointing to the data files we want to download, we want to iterate over the elements and download each file. We can use the =download.file= function to download the data files. 

The =download.file= function requires a URL as the first argument, and a file name as the second argument. We can use the =basename= function to strip of the location part of the URL, leaving only the file name. We could do this verbosely by writing one line for each file:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent :eval no
  ## download.file(dataLinks[1], basename(dataLinks[1]))
  ## download.file(dataLinks[2], basename(dataLinks[2]))
  ## ...
  ## download.file(dataLinks[n], basename(dataLinks[3]))
#+END_SRC
but that is too much typing. First, it would be more convenient if the =download.file= function defaulted to =destfile = basename(url)=. Fortunately it is very easy to write your own functions in R. We can write a wrapper around the =download.file= function like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ## a simple function to make downloading files easier
  downloadFile <- function(url, # url to download
                           destfile = basename(url), # default name to save to
                           outdir = "./dataSets/", # default directory to save in
                           ... # other named arguments passed to download.file
                           ){
    ## create output directory if it doesn't exist
    if(!dir.exists(outdir)) {
      dir.create(outdir)
    }
    ## download the file using the specified url, output directory, and file name
    download.file(url = url, destfile = paste(outdir, destfile, sep = ""), ...)
  }
#+END_SRC

Using this function we can download the data files more conveniently, but we haven't yet addressed how to avoid typing out separate function calls for each file we need to download. For that we need iteration.

* Downloading all the files
To download all the files conveniently we want to iterate over the vector of URLs and download each one. We can carry out this iteration in several ways, including using a =for= loop, or using one of the =apply= family of functions.

=for= and =while= loops in R work much the same as they do in other programming languages. The =apply= family of functions apply a function to each element of an object.

** Iterating using for-loop
One way to download the data files is to use a for-loop to iterate over the contents of our vector of URLs. Some people will tell you to avoid for-loops in R but this is nonsense. Loops are convenient and useful, and while they are not the best tool for all situations calling for iteration they are perfectly appropriate for downloading a series of files. If you've used a for loop in any other language you will probably find the R implementation to be very similar.

For loops in R have the following general structure:
=for(<placeholder> in <thing to iterate over>) {do stuff with placeholder}=. In our case we want to iterate over =dataLinks= and download each one, so this becomes
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ## make a directory to store the data
  dir.create("dataSets")

  for(link in dataLinks) {
      downloadFile(link, outdir = "dataSets/")
  }
#+END_SRC

** Iterating over vectors and lists with the =sapply= function
The =sapply= function iterates over a vector or list and applies a function to each element. To start, let's use =sapply= do download all the displaced worker survey data files:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ## download all the dws data
  sapply(dataLinks,
         downloadFile,
         outdir = "dataSets/")
#+END_SRC


We can now use what we've learned about iteration to unzip all the files in the =dataSets= directory, a task I leave to you.

* Exercise 1: Iterate and extract

Use a =for= loop or =*apply= function to unzip each of the =.zip= files in the =dataSets= directory.

BONUS (optional): calculate the size of each extracted file and calculate the difference in size between each =.dta= file and the =.zip= file it was extracted from.
* Exercise 1 prototype                                            :prototype:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  dataFiles <- list.files("dataSets", pattern = "\\.dta$", full.names=TRUE)

  ## using sapply
  sapply(dataFiles, unzip, exdir = "dataSets")
  ## using a for loop
  for(f in dataFiles) unzip(f, exdir = "dataSets")

  ## Calculating compression ratios
  uncompSize <- round(file.size(dataFiles) / 1024^2)
  compSize <- round(file.size(dataFiles) / 1024^2)

  cbind(zipFile = paste0(basename(dataFiles), ": ", compSize, "Mb"),
        dtaFile = paste0(basename(dataFiles), ": ", uncompSize, "Mb"),
        diff = paste0(round(uncompSize - compSize), "Mb"),
        compression_ratio = round(uncompSize / compSize, digits = 3))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Importing and inspecting data and meta-data 
Our next goal is to read in the data that we downloaded and extracted earlier. The data are stored as Stata data sets, which can be imported using the =read.dta= function in the =foreign= package. Let's start by reading just the first data set.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  ## attach the foreign packge so we can read stata files
  library(foreign)

  ## get a list of all the stata files in the dataSets directory
  dataFiles <- list.files("dataSets", pattern = "\\.dta$", full.names=TRUE)

  ## read in the first one
  ceprData1 <- read.dta(dataFiles[1])
#+END_SRC

Now that we've read in some of the data we want to get some more information about it. 

** Mode and length
Information about objects in R are stored as /attributes/ of the object. All R objects have a storage /mode/ and a /length/. Since all objects in R have the attributes we refer to them as /intrinsic attributes/. We can get the value of these intrinsic attributes using the =mode= and =length= functions respecively. For example, what is the mode and length of our =ceprData1= object?
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  mode(ceprData1)
  length(ceprData1)
#+END_SRC  

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> mode(ceprData1)
[1] "list"
> length(ceprData1)
[1] 178
> 
#+end_example

** Other properties of data.frames
So far we've seen that =ceprData1= is a list of length 178. Actually =ceprData1= is a special kind of list called a =data.frame=. We can see that by asking R what the =class= of the object is.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  class(ceprData1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

A /data.frame/ in R is a list with elements of equal length. It is a rectangular structure with rows and columns. In addition to the /mode/ and /length/ that all object in R have, /data.frames/ also have dimension, (col)names, and =rownames.

** Additional attributes
OK, so far we know the ceprData1 is a /data.frame/ with 156246 rows and 178 columns, and that the variables have terrible cryptic names like =cjpporg= and =ljagric=. What do we actually have here? One way to answer the question is
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  browseURL(ceprCodeBookLinks[1])
#+END_SRC
and that is a good answer actually. In our case the meta-data has also been embedded in the =.dta= files by our friends at [[http://ceprdata.org][ceprdata.org]]. This meta-data has been attached to the =ceprData1= data.frame in the form of additional attributes. 

The system used by R for storing attributes of this kind is simple. Arbitrary attributes can be set using the =attr= function, and retrieved using either =attr= or the =attributes= function. Let's take a quick look a this system before using it to access the ceprData1 meta-data.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  x <- 1:10
  attributes(x)
  attr(x, "description") <- "This is vector of integers from 1 to 10"
  attributes(x)
  attr(x, "how_many") <- "There are ten things in this vector"
  attributes(x)
  attr(x, "description")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> x <- 1:10
> attributes(x)
NULL
> attr(x, "description") <- "This is vector of integers from 1 to 10"
> attributes(x)
$description
[1] "This is vector of integers from 1 to 10"

> attr(x, "how_many") <- "There are ten things in this vector"
> attributes(x)
$description
[1] "This is vector of integers from 1 to 10"

$how_many
[1] "There are ten things in this vector"

> attr(x, "description")
[1] "This is vector of integers from 1 to 10"
> 
#+end_example

 
As we've seen, additional attributes and be accessed vie the =attributes= function. Let's see what other attributes our =ceprData= object has.
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ceprDataInfo <- attributes(ceprData1)
  mode(ceprDataInfo)
  class(ceprDataInfo)
  length(ceprDataInfo)
  names(ceprDataInfo)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> ceprDataInfo <- attributes(ceprData1)
> mode(ceprDataInfo)
[1] "list"
> class(ceprDataInfo)
[1] "list"
> length(ceprDataInfo)
[1] 12
> names(ceprDataInfo)
 [1] "datalabel"        "time.stamp"       "names"            "formats"         
 [5] "types"            "val.labels"       "var.labels"       "expansion.fields"
 [9] "row.names"        "version"          "label.table"      "class"           
> 
#+end_example

Let's iterate over the attributes of =ceprData1- and get some more information about the available meta-data
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  t(sapply(attributes(ceprData1),
           function(x) {
             c(mode = mode(x), class = class(x), length = length(x))
           })
    )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> t(sapply(attributes(ceprData1),
+          function(x) {
+            c(mode = mode(x), class = class(x), length = length(x))
+          })
+   )
                 mode        class       length  
datalabel        "character" "character" "1"     
time.stamp       "character" "character" "1"     
names            "character" "character" "178"   
formats          "character" "character" "178"   
types            "numeric"   "integer"   "178"   
val.labels       "character" "character" "178"   
var.labels       "character" "character" "178"   
expansion.fields "list"      "list"      "525"   
row.names        "character" "character" "156246"
version          "numeric"   "integer"   "1"

class            "character" "character" "1"     
> 
#+end_example

** Extracting useful meta-data
We can extract elements from lists in a few different ways:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ## extract by name
  ceprDataInfo$datalabel #using $
  ceprDataInfo["datalabel"] #using [
  ceprDataInfo[["datalabel"] #using [[, note the difference
  
  ## by position
  ceprDataInfo[1]; ceprDataInfo[[1]] # note the difference
  
  ## by logical index
  ceprDataInfo[c(TRUE, TRUE, rep(FALSE, 10))]
  ceprDataInfo[sapply(ceprDataInfo, length) == 1]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Note that =[= indexing on a list returns a list, and =[[= indexing returns whatever contained in a single element of the list. This visual explanation may help: 
[[file:images/HadleyWickham_index_list.png]][fn:3]

You may have noticed during our earlier investigation of =ceprDataInfo= that many of the elements have length 178. That number might be familiar:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  dim(ceprData1)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
> dim(ceprData1)
[1] 156246    178
> 
#+end_example
it's the number of columns in the data set. It is therefor a good guess that those elements record information about each of the columns in the data set. 

*** Exercise 2

Extract elements from =ceprDataInfo= that will help you understand what each column in =deprData= contains. Include at least the variable =names= and =var.labels= as well as any other information that you think will be useful.

Bonus (optional): supplement the =ceprDataInfo= you extracted in step one with the mode, class, etc. of each column in =ceprData1=

* Aggregation
Now that we have the data read in, and we know what is in each column, I want to calculate the proportion displaced by year/rural/gender. I can do that using the =aggregate= function (the =data.table= and =dplyr= packages provide advanced aggregation capabilities, but =aggregate= is available in base R and works well for many things).

#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ceprData1 <- aggregate(ceprData1["dw"],
                         by = ceprData1[c("year", "rural", "female")],
                         FUN = mean)
  ceprData1
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Exercise 3

Now that we have a process for importing and aggregating the data we can apply it to all the data files we downloaded earlier. We can do that by wrapping the =read.dta= and =aggregate= code in a function and applying that function to each element of =dataFiles= using the =sapply= function, or using a =for= loop. Go ahead and give it a try! Note that this exercise is intentionally challenging; read the documentation, search stackoverflow.com, and use any other resources at your disposal as you attempt it.

* Exercise 3 prototype                                            :prototype:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  library(foreign)

  ceprData <- sapply(dataFiles, function(x) {
    tmp <- read.dta(x)
    return(aggregate(tmp["dw"],
                     by = tmp[c("year", "rural", "female")],
                     FUN = mean})),
    simplify = FALSE)
#+END_SRC

*  Finishing touches

We now have a list of aggregated data.frames. The next step is to stack each element of the list so that we end up with one big data.frame instead of a list of small ones. We can stack two data.frames using the =rbind= function:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  ceprData[[1]]; ceprData[[2]]
  rbind(ceprData[[1]], ceprData[[2]])
#+END_SRC  

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example

and we can apply this operation to every element in the list using the =do.call= function.
#+BEGIN_SRC R

#+end_example

** Data formatting

Our final step before plotting our data is to format the values for =rural= and =female=. Currently these values are stored as 0/1 dummy codes, but I would like for the values to be spelled out. 

Earlier we saw how to extract elements of R objects using bracket notation. To replace elements we using the replacement form, which looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
   ceprData[["rural"]] <- factor(ceprData[["rural"]],
                                 levels = c(0, 1),
                                 labels = c("Non-rural", "Rural"))

   ceprData[["gender"]] <- factor(ceprData[["female"]],
                                 levels = c(1, 0),
                                 labels = c("Female", "Male"))

  ceprData$displaced_percent <- ceprData$dw * 100

  str(ceprData)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
>  ceprData[["rural"]] <- factor(ceprData[["rural"]],
+                                levels = c(0, 1),
+                                labels = c("Non-rural", "Rural"))
> 
>  ceprData[["gender"]] <- factor(ceprData[["female"]],
+                                levels = c(1, 0),
+                                labels = c("Female", "Male"))
> 
> ceprData$displaced_percent <- ceprData$dw * 100
> 
> str(ceprData)
'data.frame':	36 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ year             : int  1994 1994 1994 1994 1996 1996 1996 1996 1998 1998 ...
 $ rural            : Factor w/ 2 levels "Non-rural","Rural": 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 ...
 $ female           : int  0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 ...
 $ dw               : num  0.092 0.0709 0.0606 0.0458 0.1021 ...
 $ gender           : Factor w/ 2 levels "Female","Male": 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 ...
 $ displaced_percent: num  9.2 7.09 6.06 4.58 10.21 ...
> 
#+end_example

** Plotting

Now we can take a look at the trends in worker displacement over the last few years.
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file images/out.png :width 900 :heigth 900
  library(ggplot2)
  library(directlabels)
  ceprPlot <- ggplot(ceprData, aes(x = year, y = displaced_percent, color = gender)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~rural)
  direct.label(ceprPlot)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/out.png]]

* What else?

If there is anything else you want to learn how to do, now is the time to ask!


* Go forth and code!
You now know everything you could possibly want to know about R. OK maybe not! But you do know how to manipulate character strings with regular expressions, write your own functions, execute code conditionally, iterate using =for= or =sapply=, inspect and modify attributes, and extract and replace object elements. There's a lot more to learn, but that's a pretty good start. As you go forth and write your own R code here are some resources that may be helpful.

** Things that may surprise you

 There are an unfortunately large number of surprises in R programming. Some of these "gotcha's" are common problems in other languages, many are unique to R. We will only cover a few -- for a more comprehensive discussion please see http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf


*** Floating point comparison

Floating point arithmetic is not exact:
#+name: floatingPointExample
#+begin_src R
  .1 == .3/3
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: floatingPointExample
#+begin_example
> .1 == .3/3
[1] FALSE
> 
#+end_example

Solution: ~use all.equal()~:
#+name: floatingPointExampleSolution
#+begin_src R
  all.equal(.1, .3/3)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: floatingPointExampleSolution
#+begin_example
> all.equal(.1, .3/3)
[1] TRUE
> 
#+end_example

*** Missing values
R does not exclude missing values by default -- a single missing value in a vector means that many thing are unknown:
#+name: MissingDataExample
#+begin_src R
  x <- c(1:10, NA, 12:20)
  c(mean(x), sd(x), median(x), min(x), sd(x))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: MissingDataExample
#+begin_example
> x <- c(1:10, NA, 12:20)
> c(mean(x), sd(x), median(x), min(x), sd(x))
[1] NA NA NA NA NA
> 
#+end_example

NA is not equal to anything, not even NA
#+name: NAcomp
#+begin_src R
  NA == NA
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: NAcomp
#+begin_example
> NA == NA
[1] NA
> 
#+end_example

Solutions: use ~na.rm = TRUE~ option when calculating, and is.na to test for missing

*** Automatic type conversion

Automatic type conversion happens a lot which is often useful, but makes it easy to miss mistakes

#+name: typeConversion
#+begin_src R
  # combining values coereces them to the most general type
  (x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 1, 2, "a", "b"))
  str(x)
  
  # comparisons convert arguments to most general type
  1 > "a"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: typeConversion
#+begin_example
> # combining values coereces them to the most general type
> (x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, 1, 2, "a", "b"))
[1] "TRUE"  "FALSE" "1"     "2"     "a"     "b"    
> str(x)
 chr [1:6] "TRUE" "FALSE" "1" "2" "a" "b"
> 
> # comparisons convert arguments to most general type
> 1 > "a"
[1] FALSE
> 
#+end_example

Maybe this is what you expect... I would like to at least get a warning!

*** Optional argument inconsistencies
Functions you might expect to work similarly don't always:

#+name: MeanVSsd
#+begin_src R
  mean(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)*5
  sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: MeanVSsd
#+begin_example
> mean(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)*5
[1] 5
> sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
[1] 15
> 
#+end_example

Why are these different?!?
#+name: MeanVSsdExplained
#+begin_src R
  args(mean)
  args(sum)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: MeanVSsdExplained
#+begin_example
> args(mean)
function (x, ...) 
NULL
> args(sum)
function (..., na.rm = FALSE) 
NULL
> 
#+end_example

Ouch. That is not nice at all!

*** Trouble with Factors

Factors sometimes behave as numbers, and sometimes as characters, which can be confusing!

#+name: factorTrouble
#+begin_src R
  (x <- factor(c(5, 5, 6, 6), levels = c(6, 5)))
  
  str(x)
  
  as.character(x)
  # here is where people sometimes get lost...
  as.numeric(x)
  # you probably want
  as.numeric(as.character(x))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: factorTrouble
#+begin_example
> (x <- factor(c(5, 5, 6, 6), levels = c(6, 5)))
[1] 5 5 6 6
Levels: 6 5
> 
> str(x)
 Factor w/ 2 levels "6","5": 2 2 1 1
> 
> as.character(x)
[1] "5" "5" "6" "6"
> # here is where people sometimes get lost...
> as.numeric(x)
[1] 2 2 1 1
> # you probably want
> as.numeric(as.character(x))
[1] 5 5 6 6
> 
#+end_example

* Footnotes

[fn:2] Finally, note also that the previous =for= and =sapply= examples are contrived; =file.size= is vectorized, and the recommended way to get this size of all the files in a directory is simply
#+BEGIN_SRC R
  file.size(dataFiles)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Now that we understand iteration in R we can use it to unzip the data files we downloaded earlier. We can unzip single files using the =unzip= function, like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :results silent
  unzip(dataFiles[[1]])
#+END_SRC
