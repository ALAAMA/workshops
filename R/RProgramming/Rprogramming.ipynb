    "\n",
    "This is an intermediate/advanced R course appropriate for those with\n",
    "basic knowledge of R. It is intended for those already comfortable with\n",
    "using R for data analysis who wish to move on to writing their own\n",
    "functions. To the extent possible this workshop uses real-world\n",
    "examples. That is to say that concepts are introduced as they are needed\n",
    "for a realistic analysis task. In the course of working through a\n",
    "realistic project we will lean about interacting with web services,\n",
    "regular expressions, iteration, functions, control flow and more.\n",

    "Prerequisite: basic familiarity with R, such as acquired from an\n",

    "Everyone should have R installed -- if not:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Open a web browser and go to <http://cran.r-project.org> and\n",
    "    download and install it\n",
    "  - Also helpful to install RStudio (download from <http://rstudio.com>)\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials for this workshop include slides, example data sets, and\n",
    "example code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Download materials from\n",

    "\n",

    "Although we could open a web browser and download these files one at a\n",
    "time, it will be faster and easier to instruct R to do that for us.\n",
