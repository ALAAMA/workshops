- Lab computer log in:
  - USERNAME: dataclass
  - PASSWORD: on the board to your left
- Download materials from [[http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/Stata/StataGraphics.zip]]
- Extract materials from the =StataGraphics.zip= file
- Launch Stata and open the =StataGraphics.do= file


** Copy the workshop materials to your home directory		   :mitsetup:

- *Log in to an Athena workstation* using your Athena user name and password

- *Click on the "Ubuntu" button* on the upper-left and type "term" as shown below
#+attr_latex: :width .8\textwidth
[[./images/OpenTerminal.png]]

- *Click on the "Terminal" icon* as shown above

- In the terminal, *type this line exactly as shown*:
#+LaTeX: {\footnotesize
: cd; wget j.mp/stata-graph; unzip stata-graph
#+LaTeX: \normalsize}

- If you see "ERROR 404: Not Found", then you mistyped the command -- try again, making sure to type the command exactly as shown. If it still doesn't work, open [[http://j.mp/stata-graph]] in a web browser and extract the zip file to your home directory.

** Launch Stata on Athena					   :mitsetup:

- To start Stata *type these commands in the terminal*:
:     add stata
:     xstata
- Open up today's Stata script

  - In Stata, go to *Window => New do file => Open*

  - Locate and open the =StataGraphics.do= script in the StataGraphics folder in your home directory

- I encourage you to add your own notes to this file!


** Organization
- Please feel free to ask questions at any point if they are relevant to the current topic (or if you are lost!)
- There will be a Q&A after class for more specific, personalized questions
- Collaboration with your neighbors is encouraged
- If you are using a laptop, you will need to adjust paths accordingly
- Make comments in your Do-file rather than on hand-outs
- Save on flash drive or email to yourself


*** Graphing Strategies
- Keep it simple
- Labels, labels, labels!!
- Avoid cluttered graphs
- Every part of the graph should be meaningful
- Avoid:
  - Shading
  - Distracting colors
  - Decoration

- Always know what you’re working with before you get started
  - Recognize scale of data
  - If you’re using multiple variables – how do their scales align?
- Before any graphing procedure review variables with =codebook=, =sum=, =tab=, etc.
- HELPFUL STATA HINT:  If you want your command to go on multiple lines use =///= at end of each line

* Univariate Graphics

** Our First Dataset
- Time Magazine Public School Poll
  - Based on survey of 1,000 adults in U.S.
  - Conducted in August 2010
  - Questions regarding feelings about parental involvement, teachers union, current potential for reform

- Open Stata and call up the datafile for today

#+name: OpenData
#+begin_src stata
  // Step 1: tell Stata where to find data:
  cd "~/StataGraphics/dataSets"
  // Step 2: call up our dataset:
  use TimePollPubSchools.dta
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: OpenData
#+begin_example

cd "~/StataGraphics/dataSets"
/nfs/home/I/izahn/StataGraphics/dataSets

use TimePollPubSchools.dta
#+end_example


** Single Continuous Variables
Example: Histograms
- Stata assumes you’re working with continuous data
- Very simple syntax: 
  - =hist varname=
- Put a comma after your varname and start adding options
  - =bin(#)= : change the number of bars that the graph displays
  - =normal= : overlay normal curve
  - =addlabels= : add actual values to bars


** Histogram Options

- To change the numeric depiction of your data add these options after the comma 
  - Choose one: density fraction frequency percent
- Be sure to properly describe your histogram:
  - =title(insert name of graph)=
  - =subtitle(insert subtitle of graph)=
  - =note(insert note to appear at bottom of graph)=
  - =caption(insert caption to appear below notes)=

** Histogram Example


#+name: hist1
#+begin_src stata
  hist F1, bin(10) percent title(TITLE) ///
    subtitle(SUBTITLE) caption(CAPTION) note(NOTES)
#+end_src


[[./images/hist1.png]]


** Axis Titles and Labels
Example: Histograms
- Axis title options (default is variable label):
  - =xtitle(insert x axis name)=
  - =ytitle(insert y axis name)=
- Don’t want axis titles?
  - =xtitle("")=
  - =ytitle("")=

- Add labels to X or Y axis:
  - xlabel(insert x axis label)
  - ylabel(insert y axis label)
- Tell Stata how to scale each axis
  - xlabel(start#(increment)end#)
  - xlabel(0(5)100)
- This would label x-axis from 0-100 in increments of 5

** Axis Labels Example

#+name: hist2
#+begin_src stata
  hist F1, bin(10) percent title(TITLE) subtitle(SUBTITLE) ///
      caption(CAPTION) note(NOTES) ///
      xtitle(Here's your x-axis title) ///
  ytitle(here's your y-axis title)
#+end_src


[[./images/hist2.png]]



** Basic Graphing: Single Categorical Variables
- We can also use the =hist= command for bar graphs
  - Simply specify "discrete" with options 
- Stata will produce one bar for each level (i.e. category) of variable
- Use =xlabel= command to insert names of individual categories


#+name: bargraph
#+begin_src stata
  hist F4, title(Racial breakdown of Time Poll Sample) xtitle(Race) ///
  ytitle(Percent) xlabel(1 "White" 2 "Black" 3 "Asian" 4 "Hispanic" ///
   5 "Other") discrete percent addlabels
#+end_src


[[./images/bargraph.png]]



** Exercise 1: Histograms Bar Graphs

1. Open the datafile, NatNeighCrimeStudy.dta.
2. Create a histogram of the tract-level poverty rate (variable name: =T_POVRTY=).
3. Insert the normal curve over the histogram
4. Change the numeric representation on the Y-axis to "percent"
5. Add appropriate titles to the overall graph and the x axis and y axis.  Also, add a note that states the source of this data.
6. Open the datafile, TimePollPubSchools.dta
7. Create  a histogram of the question, "What grade would you give your child’s school" (variable name: Q11).  Be sure to tell Stata that this is a categorical variable.
8. Format this graph so that the axes have proper titles and labels.  Also, add an appropriate title to the overall graph that goes onto two lines.  Add a note stating the source of the data.


** Next Dataset:
- National  Neighborhood Crime Study (NNCS)
  - N=9,593 census tracts in 2000
  - Explore sources of variation in crime for communities in the United States
  - Tract-level data: crime, social disorganization, disadvantage, socioeconomic inequality
  - City-level data: labor market, socioeconomic inequality, population change


* Bivariate Graphics

** The Twoway Family
- =twoway= is basic Stata command for all twoway graphs
- Use =twoway= anytime you want to make comparisons among variables
- Can be used to combine graphs (i.e., overlay one graph with another
  - e.g., insert line of best fit over a scatter plot

- Some basic examples:
#+name: twowayBasic
#+begin_src stata
  use NatNeighCrimeStudy.dta
  twoway scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT
  twoway dropline T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT
  twoway  lfitci T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT
#+end_src

** Twoway and the "by" Statement

#+name: XXX
#+begin_src stata
  twoway scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT, by(DIVISION)
#+end_src



[[./images/twowayby.png]]



** Twoway Title Options
- Same title options as with histogram
  - =title(insert name of graph)=
  - =subtitle(insert subtitle of graph)=
  - =note(insert note to appear at bottom of graph)=
  - =caption(insert caption to appear below notes)=

** Twoway Title Options Example

#+name: TwowayTitleOptinsExample
#+begin_src stata
  twoway scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT, ///
      title(Comparison of Per Capita Income ///
            and Violent Crime Rate at Tract level) ///
  xtitle(Violent Crime Rate) ytitle(Per Capita Income) ///
      note(Source: National Neighborhood Crime Study 2000) 
  
#+end_src


- The title is a bit cramped--let's fix that:

#+name: TwowayTitleOptinsExample2
#+begin_src stata
  twoway scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT, ///
      title("Comparison of Per Capita Income" ///
  "and Violent Crime Rate at Tract level") ///
  xtitle(Violent Crime Rate) ytitle(Per Capita Income) ///
  note(Source: National Neighborhood Crime Study 2000) 
    
#+end_src



** Twoway Symbol Options
- A variety of symbol shapes are available: use =palette symbolpalette= to seem them and =msymbol()= to set them
[[./images/Symbol.png]]

** Twoway Symbol Options
#+name: TwowaySymbolOptinsExample
#+begin_src stata
  twoway scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT, ///
      title("Comparison of Per Capita Income" ///
  "and Violent Crime Rate at Tract level") ///
  xtitle(Violent Crime Rate) ytitle(Per Capita Income) ///
  note(Source: National Neighborhood Crime Study 2000) ///
  msymbol(Sh) mcolor("red")
#+end_src

[[./images/msymbol_mcolor.png]]




** Overlaying Twoway Graphs
- Very simple to combine multiple graphs…just put each graph command in parentheses
  - =twoway (scatter var1 var2) (lfit var1 var2)=
- Add individual options to each graph within the parentheses
- Add overall graph options as usual following the comma 
  - =twoway (scatter var1 var2) (lfit var1 var2), options=

** Overlaying Points and Lines
#+name: TwowayPointsLinesExample
#+begin_src stata
  twoway (scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT) ///
      (lfit T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT), ///
      title("Comparison of Per Capita Income" ///
            "and Violent Crime Rate at Tract level") ///
      xtitle(Violent Crime Rate) ytitle(Per Capita Income) ///
      note(Source: National  Neighborhood Crime Study 2000)
#+end_src


** Overlaying Points and Labels

#+name: TwowayPointsLabelsExample
#+begin_src stata
  twoway (scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT if T_VIOLNT==1976, ///
          mlabel(CITY)) (scatter T_PERCAP T_VIOLNT), ///
      title("Comparison of Per Capita Income" ///
            "and Violent Crime Rate at Tract level") ///
      xlabel(0(200)2400) note(Source: National Neighborhood ///
                              Crime Study 2000) legend(off)
#+end_src



** Exercise 2: The TwoWay Family

Open the datafile, NatNeighCrimeStudy.dta.
1.	Create a basic twoway scatterplot that compares the city unemployment rate (=C_UNEMP=) to the percent secondary sector low-wage jobs (=C_SSLOW=)
2.	Generate the same scatterplot, but this time, divide the plot by the dummy variable indicating whether the city is located in the south or not (=C_SOUTH=)
3.	Change the color of the symbol that you use in this scatter plot
4.	Change the type of symbol you use to a marker of your choice
5.	Notice in your scatterplot that is broken down by =C_SOUTH=  that there is an outlier in the upper right hand corner of the "Not South" graph.  Add the city name label to this marker. 
6.	Review the options available under "help twoway_options" and change one aspect of your graph using an option that we haven’t already reviewed


* More Fun with Twoway Line Graphs

** Line Graphs
- Line graphs helpful for a variety of data
  - Especially any type of time series data
- We’ll use data on US life expectancy from 1900-1999
  - =webuse uslifeexp, clear=

** Line Graphs

#+name: TwowayLinegraphExample2
#+begin_src stata
  webuse uslifeexp, clear
  twoway (line le_wm year, mcolor("red")) ///
      (line le_bm year, mcolor("green"))
#+end_src

[[./images/lineGraph1.png]]



** Line Graphs

#+name: TwowayLineGraphExample2
#+begin_src stata
  twoway (line (le_wfemale le_wmale le_bf le_bm) year, ///
      lpattern(dot solid dot solid))
#+end_src

[[./images/linegraph2.png]]



** Stata Graphing Lines

#+name: TwowayPointsLinesExample
#+begin_src stata
  palette linepalette
#+end_src

[[./images/linepalette.png]]



** Exporting Graphs
- From Stata, right click on image and select "save as" or try syntax:
  - =graph export myfig.esp, replace=
- In Microsoft Word: insert > picture > from file
  - Or, right click on graph in Stata and copy and paste into Word
